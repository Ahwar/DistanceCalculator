# Calculating Distance Between Points for Computer Vision

To calculate distance between two points we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for any side of the polygon.

Often in computer vision problems you are solving for side c, because you are trying to calculate the distance between two object points that are on different horizontal and vertical planes.  

By using the coordinates (x1, y1) representing the right most point on the triangle and coordinates (x2, y2) representing the top most point.

We can use a^2 + b^2 = c^2 to determine the distance between two points.
